<h2>ยง1.5 | The Limit of a Function</h2>

    <h3>Vertical Asymptote (Definition ยง1.5.6)</h3>
    
    The vertical line <tex>x = a</tex> is called the **vertical asymptote** of the curve <tex>y = f(x)</tex> if at least one of the following statements is true:

<h2>ยง1.6 | Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws</h2>

<note>
    <h3>Limit Laws</h3>

    Suppose that <tex>c</tex> is a constant and that the limits <tex>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</tex> and <tex>\lim_{x \to a} g(x)</tex> exists, then:

    <h3>Power Law</h3>
    <tex block>
        \lim_{x \to a} \Big[ f(x) \Big]^n = \Big[ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \Big]^n
    </tex>
    <note warning>
        <p><tex>n</tex> must be a positive integer.</p>
    </note>
</note>

<note>
    <h3>Root Law</h3>
    <tex block>
        \lim_{x \to a} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{\lim_{x \to a} f(x)}
    </tex>
    <note warning>
        <tex>n</tex> must be a positive integer.
    </note>
    <note>
        If <tex>n</tex> is even, we assume that <tex>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) > 0</tex>.

<h2>ยง1.8 | Continuity</h2>

<note>
    <h3>The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)</h3>

    Suppose that <tex>f</tex> is continuous on the closed interval <tex>[a, b]</tex>, and let N be any number between <tex>f(a)</tex> and <tex>f(b)</tex>, where <tex>f(a) \neq f(b)</tex>, then there exists a number <tex>c</tex> in <tex>(a, b)</tex> such that <tex>f(c) = N</tex>.

    <p>Or alternatively, suppose <tex>f</tex> is a function that is continuous at every point in the interval <tex>[a, b]:</tex></p>

<ul>
    <li><tex>f</tex> will take on every value between <tex>f(a)</tex> and <tex>f(b)</tex> over the interval.</li>
    <li>For any L between the values <tex>f(a)</tex> and <tex>f(b)</tex>, there exists a number <tex>c</tex> in <tex>[a, b]</tex> for which <tex>f(c) = L</tex>.</li>
</ul>


<note>
    <ul>
        <li>The intermediate value theorem states that if a continuous function attains two values, it must also attain all values in between these two values.</li>
        <li>The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every intermediate value between the function values <tex>f(a)</tex> and <tex>f(b)</tex>.</li>
        <li>The statement of the theorem has multiple requirements, all of which are necessary for the conclusion to hold.</li>
    </ul>
</note>

<note>
    The IVT can be used to show that a root exists, if given some interval between <tex>a</tex> and <tex>b</tex>: 

    <ul>
        <li><tex>f(a)</tex> is negative</li>
        <li><tex>f(b)</tex> is positive</li>
    </ul>

    or

    <ul>
        <li><tex>f(a)</tex> is positive</li>
        <li><tex>f(b)</tex> is negative</li>
    </ul>

    <p>then therefore, if the function is continuous, then there must be a value for which some <tex>x</tex> in <tex>f(x) = 0</tex> exists. I.e. that a root exists. Which should make sense.</p>

    <p>**More generally**, this can be extended to any value between some interval. For instance, if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><tex>f(a) = 3</tex></li
        <li><tex>f(a) = 9</tex></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then there must exist some value that we will call <tex>x</tex>, for which:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><tex>f(x) = 6</tex></li>
    </ul>
