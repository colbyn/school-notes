                \text{Area} &= \frac{1}{2} \; b h \\

        <h4>Theorem</h4>
        <p>The area K of triangle ABC is one-half the product of the lengths of any two sides and the sine of the included angle. Thus</p>
        <tex block>K = \frac{1}{2}bc \cdot \sin(A)</tex>
        <tex block>K = \frac{1}{2}ab \cdot \sin(C)</tex>
        <tex block>K = \frac{1}{2}ac \cdot \sin(B)</tex>
    </note>
    <note>
        <p>Because each formula requires two sides and the included angle, it is necessary to learn only one formula.</p>

    <h3>Heron’s Formula for Finding the Area of a Triangle</h3>
    <p>If a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, then the area K of the triangle is</p>
    <tex block>
        K = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \; \text{where} \; s = \frac{1}{2}(a + b + c)

<h2>§4.3 | Vectors</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The magnitude and direction of a vector can be found from its components.</li>
    <li>A <b>unit vector</b> is a vector whose magnitude is 1.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Definition of a Vector</h3>
    <p>A vector is a directed line segment. The length of the line segment is the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the vector is measured by an angle.</p>
