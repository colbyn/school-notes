<p>To find an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval, we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by (7)] or it occurs at an endpoint of the interval, as we see from the examples in Figure 8. Thus the following three-step procedure always works. **See The Closed Interval Method.**</p>

    <li><a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/meanvalue.html">What is the point of the mean value theorem?</a></li>

    <li>The mean value theorem says that the average speed of the car (the slope of the secant line) is equal to the instantaneous speed (slope of the tangent line) at some point(s) in the interval.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    In mathematics, the mean value theorem states, roughly, that for a given planar arc between two endpoints, there is at least one point at which the tangent to the arc is parallel to the secant through its endpoints.
</blockquote>

<p>For any function that is continuous <span inline="" math-inline="">\([a, b]\)</span> and differentiable on <span inline="" math-inline="">\((a,b)\)</span>, there exists some <span inline="" math-inline="">\(c\)</span> in the interval <span inline="" math-inline="">\((a,b)\)</span> such that the secant joining the endpoints of the <span inline="" math-inline="">\([a, b]\)</span> is parallel to the tangent at <span inline="" math-inline="">\(c\)</span>:</p>

<p>Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a function f from information concerning its derivatives.
</p>

<p>Because stem:[f^\prime(x)] represents the slope of the curve stem:[y = f(x)] at the point stem:[(x, f(x))], it tells us the direction in which the curve proceeds at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about stem:[f^\prime(x)] will provide us with information about stem:[f(x)].</p>
